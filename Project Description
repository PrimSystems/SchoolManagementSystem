            ALl upload-able goods must be categorized.. That is all goods must fall into a category to enable search and upload queires.
            Can publish/fire these requests. Not until you fire a trade request it remains in your profile or wishList.
            Note: All fired request must be approved in order to be displayed on major pages other than the user's profile page.

         Goods
         ALl goods on the home page must be approved before publishing..
         When an interest is shown for a good with the necessary match. This should take this person to the goods author's page for contact details and to see other important details of this autor such as
         - Last Seen, Chat the author up, Contact Number, transaction records, successful transactions e.t.c.
         Newly approved trades are given precedence over old goods...
